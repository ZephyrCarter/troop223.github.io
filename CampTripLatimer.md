<h1>Latimer</h1>

  <hr>

<strong>Latimer</strong> was a interesting and quite thrilling trip, with lots to do.
there were endless places and trails to walk, beautiful bodies of water which one just couldent resist taking a photo of at dawn, and a trip over a 70 foot cliff while repelling.
Truley an amazing trip!
